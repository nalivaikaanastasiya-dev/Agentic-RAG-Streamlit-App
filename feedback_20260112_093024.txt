suggestions for improvement:
- The provided notebook only contains an example `.env` file.  It needs to contain the actual agent/RAG pipeline as described in the problem description.

suggestions for improvement:
- The provided notebook only contains a list of packages. It does not attempt to implement the agentic RAG pipeline, tool use, or reasoning loop described in the problem description.
- The notebook should contain code that initializes the Groq LLM, Tavily search, and potentially Google tools using the API keys. It should also implement the retriever and agent logic.
- The notebook is missing the core functionality of building a retriever, creating an agent, implementing the reasoning loop, handling errors, and logging to LangSmith.

suggestions for improvement:
- The notebook implements a RAG pipeline, but it doesn't fully implement an 'agentic' RAG as suggested by the challenge title. It uses a RetrievalQA chain, which is a good start, but doesn't incorporate the reasoning and planning aspects of an agent. Consider integrating a more sophisticated agent framework (e.g., using LangChain's Agent classes) that can decide when to retrieve, read, and synthesize.
- The code includes loading API keys, but doesn't integrate Tavily search or Google tools as hinted in the problem description. This is a significant deviation from the intended functionality. Integrate Tavily for web search and explore Google tools (if applicable) to enhance the agent's capabilities.
- Error handling and LangSmith tracing are mentioned but not implemented. Add try-except blocks to handle potential errors (e.g., API timeouts, invalid responses) gracefully. Also, configure LangSmith tracing to log agent runs for debugging and monitoring.
- The knowledge base (kb_docs) is hardcoded. For a more realistic application, consider loading the knowledge base from a file or database.
- The prompt template can be improved to better guide the LLM's response and ensure proper source attribution. Be more explicit about the expected format of the output and the importance of citing sources inline.
