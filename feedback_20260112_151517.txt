suggestions for improvement:
- The provided code only contains placeholder API keys and does not implement any of the required functionality (RAG pipeline, agent, tool usage, error handling, LangSmith logging).
- The notebook should contain the agent and RAG pipeline logic.

suggestions for improvement:
- Consider adding more detailed comments within the code to explain complex logic or design choices, enhancing readability.
- Explore ways to optimize the agent's performance, such as using more efficient vectorstore indexing or caching mechanisms, especially for frequently accessed information.

suggestions for improvement:
- The provided code is the `app.py` code embedded inside an `.ipynb` notebook, but it's supposed to be a notebook called `agentic_rag.ipynb` that implements the agent and RAG pipeline. The `app.py` code is meant to load this notebook (which should contain the Agentic RAG implementation) and call its functions.
- The notebook should contain the actual implementation of the agentic RAG pipeline and tool usage.

URL: https://github.com/nalivaikaanastasiya-dev/Agentic-RAG-Streamlit-App/blob/main/requirements.txt.ipynb
suggestions for improvement:
- The submitted code consists of an empty notebook and a list of Python packages which does not implement the core functionality described in the problem description.
- The notebook should contain the agent and RAG pipeline implementation.
- The notebook is currently storing the `requirements.txt` content, this is incorrect and should be a separate file.
