suggestions for improvement:
- The submitted code is just a template for a .env file. It does not implement any of the requested functionalities: building a retriever, an agent with tool calling, orchestrating a reasoning loop, or exposing a Python API for the Streamlit app. It simply provides placeholder values for API keys.

suggestions for improvement:
- Consider using a more robust vector database solution or configuration if the application needs to scale or handle more complex data.
- Improve the error handling within the `create_vectordb` function to provide more specific error messages to the user, guiding them on how to resolve the issue.
- Implement more comprehensive logging to capture the inputs and outputs of each tool call, which can be useful for debugging and analysis.
- Refactor the agent initialization to allow more flexibility in configuring the agent's behavior, such as specifying the agent type and prompt templates.

URL: https://github.com/nalivaikaanastasiya-dev/Agentic-RAG-Streamlit-App/blob/main/app_py.ipynb
suggestions for improvement:
- The provided code is in a notebook format which combines the Streamlit application (`app.py`) and potentially the agent/RAG pipeline logic (`agentic_rag.ipynb`). This does not align with the instructions, as `app.py` is meant to be a separate file that calls `agentic_rag.ipynb` (or a corresponding Python file) for the agent logic.
- The code attempts to load a PDF, which is not explicitly specified in the requirements, which focus on using Tavily, Groq, and optional Google tools for web search and grounding answers.
- The notebook preview attempts to load `agentic_rag.ipynb` as text, as specified, but the main logic should be in Python files, not just a notebook.

suggestions for improvement:
- The notebook appears to only list package names, rather than implement any part of the agentic RAG pipeline. The prompt requires building a retriever, agent with tool use, orchestration of reasoning, retrieval and synthesis, exposing a python API, and handling errors. None of these things are accomplished here.
- The notebook should contain code that addresses the prompt's requirements of creating an agentic RAG pipeline that integrates a retriever, agent, and the ability to call tools (Tavily, Groq).
- The notebook should implement the reasoning → retrieve → read → synthesize loop with source attribution, as described in the prompt.
